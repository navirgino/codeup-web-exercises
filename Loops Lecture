/*
* WHILE LOOPS
*/

// 1. Create a while loop that counts to 100 in increments of ten:
// (10...20...30...)

// 2. Create a while loop that counts backwards from 50 - 1


var myQuestion;

// 3. Create a while loop that asks the user for a confirmation when asked: "Would you like to exit?"
// Store the confirm in the myQuestion variable.
// Try running this. What happens?


/*
* DO-WHILE LOOPS
*/


// 4. Refactor question 3 using a do-while loop.
// What is the behavior this time?

// 5. Create a do-while loop that prompts the user for a color and continues
// to prompt until the string passed is "blue"

// 6. Refactor question 1 using a do-while loop.


/*
* FOR LOOPS
*/

var myArray = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas", "grapes", "pineapples"];

// 7. Create a for loop that iterates over this array and logs out each
// element to the console


// 8. You are going to use a for loop to complete the FizzBuzz exercise.
// Your program should count up to 100.
// For numbers divisible by 3, log "Fizz"
// For numbers divisible by 5, log "Buzz"
// If divisible by 3 and 5, log "FizzBuzz"
// All other cases, just log the number.

// 9. Refactor question 1 using a for-loop
// 10. Write a for-loop 


/*
* BREAK AND CONTINUE
*/

// 11. Refactor question 1: using a 'break', stop the counting once it hits 70.

// 12. Refactor question 2: using a 'continue', skip numbers 50-26 and only
// log 25 - 1.
